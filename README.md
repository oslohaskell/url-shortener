Simple URL Shortener Web App
----------------------------

Simple URL shortener using [Scotty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty)
that was written at the 18 May OsÎ»o Haskell meetup.

To get this up and running, first create a sandbox:

    $ cabal sandbox init

To install the `sqlite-simple` dependency, you will need to install sqlite and
its headers. (E.g. for OS X, run `brew install sqlite`.)

We can then install the dependencies, create the database and run the app:

    $ cabal install --only-dependencies
    $ sqlite3 mapping.db 'CREATE TABLE mapping (key text PRIMARY KEY, url text);'
    $ cabal run

You should then be able to open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

A good way to make changes and quickly test them is to run `cabal repl` and
then use `:edit` to open the file in your `$EDITOR`. You can then run `main` by
typing `main` and pressing enter.
